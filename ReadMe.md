# My Note:
### 1. Note: "ExceptionsDemo"
It's important to call 'scanner.next()' to prevent potential bugs. Without it, 'number = scanner.nextDouble()' or 'scanner.nextDouble()' could cause an infinite loop.

### 2. Note: checked-exception:
A type of exception in Java that must be anticipated and handled in the code before the program can be executed, ensuring smoother program flow.

### 3. Note: Unchecked-exceptions
Unchecked exceptions indeed occur during runtime, not during compilation. They are typically caused by issues like invalid input, null references, or arithmetic errors during program execution, rather than problems detected during compilation.
